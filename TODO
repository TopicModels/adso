# Known problems

### Reproducibility not achievied
[ ] LDAVB
[ ] LDAGS
[ ] HDPVB
[ ] HDPGS

# Future features

### General improvements
[x] Update README to conda
[x] migrate from poetry to setup.py for build and upload
[ ] test pypy
[ ] check order preserving for large dataset of actual implementation of vectorizer
[x] Allow to save and load TopicModel OR create Experiment envelop
[ ] print some messages?
[ ] Add support for multiple label level
[ ] Reactivate github actions
[ ] HDBSCAN uncertain labels
[ ] Sparse to zarr? [GitHub](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/issues/152)
[ ] Adopt ray as backend
[ ] Complete rework (maybe switch to Julia/Rust with python API)

### Additional Topic Modellind algorithms
[x] NMF
[x] LDA (Blei03a)
[x] Smoothed LDA (Blei03a)
[x] Symmetric LDA (Blei03a and Blei & Lafferty)
[x] HDP (Teh, Jordan, Beal & Blei)
[x] Gibb's sample LDA (Griffiths & Steyvers)
[ ] [Future] DTM Blei & Lafferty
[x] hSBM (Gerlach, Peixoto & Altman)
[x] TopicMapping (Lancichinetti, Amaral et al) (with InfoMap, Louvain and Leiden clustering algorithms)
[x] Pure PLSA [GitHub](https://github.com/henryre/numba-plsa/blob/cab7f869648c223d8aa3657b0c3044e5bb788de2/numba_plsa/plsa_numba.py) [ArXiV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.3900)

### Additional feature
[ ] Implement stopwords method as in Gerlach, Shi, Amaral 2019
[x] Implement metrics (p.e. perplexity Blei03a) and plot
[ ] Syntetic corpora generative algorithms

### Additional datasets
[ ] [Web->Kb](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/data/)
[ ] Multilanguage Dataset like [Cross-Language](https://github.com/FerreroJeremy/Cross-Language-Dataset) or [xml-mt](https://github.com/salesforce/localization-xml-mt)

### CI
[x] Switch CI to conda [LINK](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-miniconda)
[ ] Add docs autobuild [LINK](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sphinx-build)
[x] Check if python version is correct in each CI step
